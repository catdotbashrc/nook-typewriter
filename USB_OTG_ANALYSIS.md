```

## Implementation Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
1. **Micro USB OTG Cable**: Standard micro-B to USB-A adapter
2. **Powered USB Hub**: 5V external power for keyboard/mouse
3. **USB Keyboard**: Standard HID-compliant keyboard
4. **Power Supply**: External 5V supply for USB hub

### Software Implementation Steps

#### 1. Switch to USB Host Mode
```bash
# Check current mode
cat /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode
# Returns: b_idle

# Switch to host mode (REQUIRES OTG CABLE CONNECTED)
echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode
```

#### 2. Enable VBUS Power (if supported)
```bash
# Check VBUS status
cat /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/vbus

# May require TWL4030 power control
# Device likely needs external power for reliable operation
```

#### 3. Monitor Device Detection
```bash
# Watch for new USB devices
watch -n 1 'ls /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/usb1/'

# Check input devices
cat /proc/bus/input/devices

# Monitor new input events
cat /dev/input/event3  # (next available event device)
```

#### 4. Keyboard Integration
```bash
# Test keyboard input
cat /dev/input/by-id/usb-*-kbd  # or next event device

# For writing integration, map to terminal
# Vim will automatically recognize new keyboard input
```

### Recommended Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Basic OTG Testing
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect micro USB OTG cable
   - Attach powered USB hub
   - Connect simple USB keyboard

2. **Software Test**:
   ```bash
   # Backup current mode
   ORIGINAL_MODE=$(cat /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode)
   
   # Switch to host mode
   echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode
   
   # Test device detection
   ls /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/usb1/
   
   # Restore original mode if needed
   echo "$ORIGINAL_MODE" > /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode
   ```

#### Phase 2: Writing Environment Integration
1. **Automatic Mode Switching**:
   - Create udev rules for OTG cable detection
   - Automatic host mode when OTG cable inserted
   - Return to device mode when cable removed

2. **Keyboard Layout Configuration**:
   - Configure keymaps for writing-optimized layouts
   - Special function keys for Nook-specific features
   - Vim integration with external keyboard

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Power Management**:
   - Smart USB power control
   - Battery preservation during host mode
   - Low-power keyboard detection

2. **Multi-Device Support**:
   - USB mouse support (if desired)
   - USB storage device mounting
   - Multiple keyboards/input devices

## Current Limitations & Solutions

### Limitation 1: Power Supply
**Issue**: Nook may not provide enough power for all USB keyboards
**Solution**: Use powered USB hub with external 5V supply

### Limitation 2: ADB Connection Loss
**Issue**: Switching to host mode will disconnect ADB
**Solution**: 
- Configure SSH over WiFi for remote access
- Implement safe mode switching with automatic fallback
- Test thoroughly before permanent changes

### Limitation 3: Mode Switching Complexity
**Issue**: Manual mode switching required
**Solution**:
- Create automated scripts for mode detection
- Hardware-based switching via OTG cable ID pin
- Failsafe mechanisms to prevent lock-out

## Risk Assessment
