# Archived Boot Documentation

> **Archived Date**: January 2025  
> **Reason**: Consolidated into single master document  
> **Replacement**: `/docs/JESTEROS_BOOT_MASTER.md`

## Archived Documents

### 1. JESTEROS_BOOT_PROCESS.md
- **Original Purpose**: Described two-stage boot process and installation procedures
- **Content Preserved**: Installation scripts, recovery procedures, safety features

### 2. BOOT-INFRASTRUCTURE-COMPLETE.md  
- **Original Purpose**: Hardware boot chain analysis from NookManager
- **Content Preserved**: Boot stages, memory maps, partition layout

### 3. URAM_IMAGE_ANALYSIS.md
- **Original Purpose**: uRamdisk extraction findings and Android init analysis
- **Content Preserved**: Binary dependencies, E-ink discovery, hybrid architecture insights

## Why Consolidated

These three documents had significant overlap and cross-references that made understanding the complete boot process challenging. The master document:

- Eliminates redundancy
- Provides single source of truth
- Flows logically from concept to implementation
- Integrates all discoveries into unified narrative
- Includes ready-to-use scripts and commands

## Recovery

If you need to reference the original documents for historical purposes, they are preserved here exactly as they were before consolidation.
