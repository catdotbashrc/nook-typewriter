# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical analysis and documentation from the JesterOS development process.

## Structure

- `analysis-reports/` - Technical analysis documents from various development phases
- `indexes/` - Old project indexes and navigation files
- `migration/` - Documents related to architecture migrations

## Why Archived?

These documents were essential during development but are now superseded by:
- The implemented 4-layer architecture
- Phase 1 & 2 improvements
- Current operational documentation

They are preserved here for reference but are not needed for deployment or maintenance.

## Current Documentation

See `/docs/current/` for up-to-date documentation.
