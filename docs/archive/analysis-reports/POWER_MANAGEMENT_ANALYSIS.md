## 📊 Technical Analysis

### CPU Governor Effectiveness
```
powersave:     50-100mW  → 15-18 hour battery
conservative: 100-200mW  → 10-12 hour battery
ondemand:     150-300mW  → 7-9 hour battery
performance:  200-400mW  → 6-8 hour battery
```

### Wake Lock Management
The Android wake lock system allows fine-grained control:
- `jesteros_writing`: Keep CPU awake during active writing
- Auto-release on idle for maximum power saving
- Hardware wake sources: Power button, RTC, GPIO

### Thermal Management
- Battery temperature monitoring via BQ27510
- CPU thermal throttling at 85°C
- Charging disabled above 45°C for safety
