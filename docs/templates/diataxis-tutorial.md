# [Title: Learning-Oriented Goal]
<!-- TEMPLATE: Diataxis Tutorial
     Purpose: Help beginners learn by doing
     Focus: Learning through practical experience
     Audience: Complete beginners to this feature/tool -->

## What You'll Learn

<!-- Brief, encouraging overview of what the user will accomplish -->
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to [specific skill/feature] by building a [concrete example]. By the end, you'll understand:

- [ ] [Learning outcome 1]
- [ ] [Learning outcome 2] 
- [ ] [Learning outcome 3]

## Prerequisites

<!-- What the learner needs before starting -->
Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] [Prerequisite 1 - e.g., software installed]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 2 - e.g., account created]
- [ ] [Prerequisite 3 - e.g., basic knowledge]

<!-- Optional: Time estimate -->
**Time to complete:** ~[X] minutes

## Step 1: [First Concrete Action]

<!-- Each step should be concrete and produce a visible result -->
Let's start by [action]. This will [why this matters].

```bash
# Example command or code
command --with --options
```

You should see:
```
Expected output or result
```

<!-- Explain what just happened in simple terms -->
**What's happening:** [Brief explanation of the concept introduced]

<!-- Optional: Common issues -->
> **Tip:** If you see [error], try [solution].

## Step 2: [Build on Previous Step]

Now that we have [what step 1 achieved], let's [next action].

<!-- Code example with clear comments -->
```python
# Create a new file called example.py
def example_function():
    """This function demonstrates [concept]"""
    # Step-by-step comments
    result = do_something()  # This does X
    return result
```

Try it yourself:
1. Create the file
2. Add the code
3. Run it with `python example.py`

**What you learned:** [Key concept from this step]

## Step 3: [Add Complexity Gradually]

Let's enhance what we built by adding [new feature].

<!-- Show the evolution of the code/process -->
```diff
  def example_function():
      """This function demonstrates [concept]"""
      result = do_something()
+     # New feature: error handling
+     if not result:
+         return handle_error()
      return result
```

<!-- Interactive exercise -->
**Try it yourself:** 
1. Modify your code to include [feature]
2. Test it with [test case]
3. Observe how [behavior changes]

## Step 4: [Integrate and Apply]

Now let's put it all together in a real-world example.

<!-- Complete working example -->
```python
# complete_example.py
"""
A complete working example that demonstrates
all the concepts we've learned
"""

import necessary_modules

class TutorialExample:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize with what we learned in Step 1
        self.setup()
    
    def setup(self):
        # From Step 1
        pass
    
    def process(self):
        # From Step 2 and 3
        pass
    
    def run(self):
        # Bringing it all together
        self.process()
        print("Success! You've completed the tutorial")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example = TutorialExample()
    example.run()
```

## Your Accomplishment

Congratulations! You've successfully:

✅ [Accomplished goal 1]  
✅ [Accomplished goal 2]  
✅ [Accomplished goal 3]

<!-- Provide concrete evidence of success -->
You can verify your success by:
- [ ] Running `[command]` and seeing [output]
- [ ] Checking that [file/feature] exists
- [ ] Testing that [functionality] works

## What's Next?

<!-- Guide them to next steps -->
Now that you understand [concept], you're ready to:

- **Go deeper:** Read the [Explanation: How [Feature] Works](../explanations/feature.md)
- **Use it:** Follow [How to [Common Task]](../how-to/task.md) 
- **Reference:** Check the [API Reference](../reference/api.md) for all options

<!-- Optional: Exercises for practice -->
### Practice Exercises

Want more practice? Try these challenges:

1. **Easy:** Modify the example to [simple change]
2. **Medium:** Add [new feature] to the code
3. **Advanced:** Create your own [type of thing] that [does something]
