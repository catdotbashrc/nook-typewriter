## üîå USB Keyboard Analysis

### Hardware Capabilities ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
```yaml
Controller: MUSB (Mentor Graphics USB OTG)
Mode Switching: Runtime via sysfs interface
Power Supply: 500mA USB spec (requires powered hub for most keyboards)
Current Mode: Device (ADB) ‚ü∑ Host (Keyboard)
```

**USB OTG Infrastructure**:
- MUSB dual-role controller with full host capability
- TWL4030 USB transceiver with power management
- Runtime mode switching: `echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode`
- USB HID support built into Linux 2.6.29 kernel

### Current Input Device Mapping
```
/dev/input/event0 - TWL4030 Keypad (hardware buttons)
/dev/input/event1 - GPIO keys (power/home buttons)  
/dev/input/event2 - zForce Touchscreen
/dev/input/event3+ - USB keyboards (when connected)
```

### Implementation Requirements

#### Hardware Setup
1. **Micro USB OTG Cable**: Standard micro-B to USB-A adapter (~$5)
2. **Powered USB Hub**: 5V external power for keyboard (~$15) 
3. **USB Keyboard**: Standard HID-compliant keyboard (~$15-25)
4. **Total Cost**: ~$35-45

#### Software Integration Steps

**Phase 1: Mode Switching Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# usb-keyboard-mode.sh - Switch USB to keyboard mode

# Save current mode  
ORIGINAL_MODE=$(cat /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode)

# Switch to host mode for keyboard
echo "host" > /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/mode

# Monitor for keyboard detection
watch -n 1 'ls /sys/devices/platform/musb_hdrc/usb1/'
```

**Phase 2: JesterOS Integration**
- Extend `runtime/4-hardware/input/button-handler.sh` to monitor USB input devices
- Add keyboard detection to Layer 2 (Application) services
- Create keyboard layout configuration for writing optimization

**Phase 3: Power Management**
- Implement smart USB power control for battery preservation
- Automatic mode switching based on OTG cable detection
- Failsafe mechanisms to prevent ADB lockout

### Known Limitations
- **ADB Loss**: Switching to host mode disconnects ADB (192.168.12.111:5555)
- **Power Requirements**: Most keyboards need powered hub
- **Setup Complexity**: Multiple cables and dongles required
- **Portability**: Less elegant than wireless solution

## üì° WiFi Keyboard Analysis  

### Hardware Evidence ‚úÖ CONFIRMED

**TI Combo Chip Capabilities**:
```yaml
WiFi: 802.11 b/g/n (confirmed operational)
Bluetooth: Hardware present with coexistence support
Chip: Texas Instruments WiLink series (WiFi + Bluetooth combo)
Coexistence: BThWlanCoexistEnable settings in WiFi configs
```

**Bluetooth Coexistence Proof**:
```ini
# From tiwlan.ini configurations
BThWlanCoexistEnable = 1    # Bluetooth/WiFi coexistence enabled
DC2DCMode = 0               # btSPI mux available for BT_FUNC2
```

Multiple WiFi chip variants show Bluetooth coexistence:
