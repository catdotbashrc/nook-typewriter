# Phoenix Project Technical Summary for JesterOS

## Executive Summary
The Phoenix Project is a comprehensive NST/G revival effort led by nmyshkin on XDA Forums, created to maintain Nook Simple Touch functionality after B&N's end-of-life in June 2024. This project provides critical technical insights directly applicable to JesterOS development.

## üî¥ Critical Findings for JesterOS

### 1. **Battery Drain Issue** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Unregistered devices with B&N software experience severe battery drain
- **Test Results**: 
  - Registered device: 89% battery after 7 days idle
  - Unregistered device: Dead after 7 days
- **Root Cause**: B&N system continuously attempts server contact when not registered
- **Solutions for JesterOS**:
  1. Completely remove B&N system (our approach) ‚úÖ
  2. OR implement fake registration state
  3. OR disable network polling services

### 2. **Firmware Version**
- **Recommended**: FW 1.2.2 (most stable, best community support)
- **Alternative**: FW 1.1.5 (older but functional)
- **JesterOS Status**: We're using 1.2.2 ‚úÖ

### 3. **SD Card Boot Requirements**
- **Critical**: Not all SD cards work for booting
- **Proven Working**: SanDisk Class 10
- **Required**: Proper bootable partition flags
- **JesterOS Implementation**: Already using sector 63 alignment ‚úÖ

## üìä Technical Specifications

### Hardware Models
```
NST  (BNRV300) - Nook Simple Touch
NSTG (BNRV350) - Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight
```

### Backup/Recovery Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Size | Notes |
|------|---------|------|-------|
| ClockworkMod (CWM) | Primary backup/restore | 4.6 MB | Freezes after write operations |
| NookManager | Rooting, backup | Varies | More user-friendly than CWM |
| Stock backup | System image | ~240 MB | Unmodified system |
| Custom backup | Modified system | ~300 MB | With customizations |

### Power Management Data
- Stock system idle consumption: ~1.5% battery/day (registered)
- Unregistered consumption: ~14% battery/day (severe drain)
- Custom system (B&N removed): Similar to registered (~1.5%/day)

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Modifications from Community

### 1. Launcher Replacements
- **ReLaunch** - Popular file manager/launcher
- **ADB Launcher** - Developer-friendly
- **MIUI Launcher** - Modern UI approach

### 2. Reader Applications (Phase 3 Options)
The project offers 4 different reader configurations:
- Alternative readers for different formats
- Dictionary replacements
- Enhanced UI modifications

### 3. System Optimizations
- B&N app removal methods
- Memory optimization techniques
- Boot process modifications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: CWM Freezing
- **Problem**: CWM freezes after writing to device
- **Solution**: Use NookManager for writes, CWM for backups only

### Issue 2: SD Card Compatibility
- **Problem**: Random SD cards often fail to boot
- **Solution**: Use SanDisk Class 10 cards specifically

### Issue 3: Dictionary Limitations
- **Problem**: UK version dictionary not customizable
- **Solution**: Use US version for dictionary modifications

## üéØ Actionable Items for JesterOS

### Already Implemented ‚úÖ
- [x] Using FW 1.2.2 base
- [x] B&N system removal (avoids battery drain)
- [x] Proper SD card partition alignment (sector 63)
- [x] Bootloader files (MLO, u-boot.bin)

### Should Implement üîß
- [ ] Power management monitoring (verify our consumption)
- [ ] CWM compatibility layer (for user backups)
- [ ] Battery optimization based on community findings

### Consider for Future üîÆ
- [ ] Support for community launchers as alternatives
- [ ] NookManager integration for easier rooting
- [ ] Dictionary system (US version compatible)
