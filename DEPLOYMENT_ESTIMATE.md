## üö® Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Time Impact |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Kernel panic on boot** | 30% | High | Serial console debugging | +1-2 days |
| **E-Ink driver issues** | 25% | Medium | Fallback to fbdev | +1 day |
| **Memory constraints** | 20% | Medium | Aggressive optimization | +1 day |
| **SD card compatibility** | 15% | Low | Try different cards | +0.5 days |
| **Performance issues** | 20% | Medium | Kernel tuning | +1-2 days |

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental approach**: Test each component separately
2. **Backup plans**: Maintain working chroot option
3. **Hardware recovery**: SD card can always be removed
4. **Version control**: Git branches for experiments

## üé≠ The Jester's Wisdom

```
    .-.
   (o o)  "Seven days of toil and trouble,
   | O |   Makes the kernel's power double!
    '-'    Two weeks hence, with buffer time,
           Your Nook shall write in prose and rhyme!"
```

---

## Summary

**Recommended Plan**: Allocate 2 calendar weeks with 7-10 active development days.

**Critical Path**:
1. Kernel compilation (must succeed first)
2. Boot from SD card (validates approach)
3. JesterOS integration (provides value)
4. Optimization (ensures usability)

**Success Probability**: 75% within 10 days, 90% within 14 days

The deployment is technically feasible with manageable risks. The Nook's existing SD card boot capability and our hardware reconnaissance significantly reduce uncertainty. The main time investments will be in kernel compilation, E-Ink driver optimization, and testing cycles.
