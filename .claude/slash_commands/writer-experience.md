# Writer Experience Evaluation

Analyze the Nook typewriter system through the lens of its primary users: distraction-free writers. Focus on usability, clarity, and the actual writing experience.

## Evaluation Areas

### 1. Time to Write
Assess how quickly a writer can start writing:
- Check boot sequence complexity
- Verify menu navigation is intuitive
- Measure steps from power-on to typing
- Look for unnecessary delays or prompts

### 2. Writing Workflow
Evaluate the complete writing cycle:
- **Starting**: How easy is it to create a new document?
- **Writing**: Are Vim commands writer-friendly?
- **Saving**: Is Ctrl+S properly mapped? Clear save confirmation?
- **Organizing**: Can writers find their documents easily?
- **Syncing**: Is cloud sync simple and reliable?

### 3. Error Message Clarity
Review all error messages for writer-friendliness:
- Are technical terms avoided?
- Do messages suggest solutions?
- Is the medieval theme helpful or confusing?
- Can non-technical writers understand what went wrong?

### 4. Plugin Functionality
Verify writing-focused plugins work correctly:
- **Goyo**: Does focus mode activate with `\g`?
- **Pencil**: Are writing improvements active?
- **Zettel**: Can writers manage notes effectively?
- **Word count**: Is progress visible?

Are the plugins working as expected? Do they respect resource constraints? Are there any plugins that we could use which respect our resource constraints and do not distract the user? Are we using any plugins that are resource intensive, or that distract the user with unnecessary features?

### 5. Recovery Mechanisms
Check how writers recover from common issues:
- Accidental exits (is work saved?)
- Power loss (does autosave work?)
- Sync conflicts (clear resolution?)
- Full storage (helpful warnings?)

### 6. Distraction Surface
Identify potential focus breakers:
- Any way to access internet beyond sync?
- Notifications or alerts that could interrupt?
- Complex menus that frustrate?
- Technical details that confuse?

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Can a novelist write for 2 hours without technical frustration?**
2. **Would a poet understand all error messages?**
3. **Can a journalist quickly sync their article?**
4. **Would a student find their notes after a week?**
5. **Does the system encourage or discourage writing?**

## Success Criteria

The system succeeds if:
- Writers can start writing in < 30 seconds
- No technical knowledge required for basic use
- Errors are rare and understandable
- The device "disappears" during writing
- Writers want to return to it

Remember: We're not building for developers or Linux enthusiasts. We're building for writers who chose this device to escape digital complexity.
