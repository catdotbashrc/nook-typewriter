# Memory Impact Analysis

Perform deep analysis of memory consumption to protect the sacred 160MB writing space. Every megabyte stolen from writers is a chapter that might not be written.

## Memory Budget Breakdown

### Sacred Allocations
```
Total RAM:           256MB
Debian OS:           ~95MB (maximum allowed)
Vim + Plugins:       ~10MB (acceptable)
System Buffer:       ~10MB (minimal)
----------------------------
WRITING SPACE:       ~160MB (MUST PRESERVE)
```

## Analysis Tasks

### 1. Package Memory Audit
Examine installed packages for memory waste:
- Review `nookwriter.dockerfile` for each package
- Check if alternatives exist with smaller footprint
- Identify packages that could be removed
- Calculate per-package memory cost

### 2. Runtime Memory Check
Analyze running system memory:
- Use `docker stats` to measure container usage
- Check memory with minimal system (just OS)
- Measure memory with Vim loaded
- Test memory during typical writing session

### 3. Memory Leak Detection
Look for potential memory issues:
- Scripts that don't clean up
- Services that grow over time
- Unnecessary daemons or processes
- Temp files that accumulate

### 4. Optimization Opportunities
Identify ways to reduce memory usage:
- Packages that could be replaced with lighter alternatives
- Services that could be disabled
- Configuration tweaks to reduce footprint
- Build-time optimizations

### 5. Change Impact Assessment
For any proposed changes, calculate:
- Direct memory cost (package size)
- Runtime memory cost (process usage)
- Indirect costs (dependencies, caches)
- Total impact on writing space

## Key Commands to Use

```bash
# Check Docker image size
docker images nook-system --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}"

# Monitor runtime memory
docker stats --no-stream nook-system

# Analyze package sizes in Dockerfile
# Look for apt-get install commands and research each package

# Check for unnecessary services
docker run --rm nook-system ps aux

# Measure Vim memory usage
docker run --rm nook-system sh -c "vim -c ':q' & sleep 2 && ps aux | grep vim"
```

## Warning Signs

### Red Flags (Immediate Action)
- OS footprint > 100MB
- Any single package > 10MB
- Total image > 800MB
- Writing space < 150MB

### Yellow Flags (Monitor Closely)
- OS footprint > 95MB
- Growing temp files
- Multiple small packages adding up
- Unnecessary documentation installed

## Reporting Format

Report findings as:
1. **Current Usage**: Exact MB used by OS/Vim/Services
2. **Writing Space**: Exact MB available for documents
3. **Waste Found**: Packages/services that could be removed
4. **Optimization Options**: Specific changes to free memory
5. **Risk Assessment**: Changes that might increase usage

## Files to Examine

- `nookwriter.dockerfile` - Every RUN command
- `docker-compose.yml` - Memory limits
- `config/scripts/*` - Memory-intensive operations
- System service configurations

Remember: This device has less RAM than a single Chrome tab. Every megabyte matters. The enemy is feature creep that slowly steals writing space.
