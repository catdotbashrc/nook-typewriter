# Test Suite Upgrade Summary

## What Changed (v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0)

### Before: 3 Tests + 48 Archived
- Only tested: safety, boot, functionality
- 48 overcomplicated tests in archive/
- No runtime validation
- No consistency checking
- No memory protection

### After: The 7-Test Sweet Spot
**Removed**: 48 archived tests (~2000+ lines of complexity)
**Added**: 4 new focused tests

## The New 7-Test Architecture

### üõ°Ô∏è Show Stoppers (MUST PASS)
1. **01-safety-check.sh** - Prevents device bricking
2. **02-boot-test.sh** - Ensures basic boot

### üöß Writing Blockers (SHOULD PASS)  
3. **04-docker-smoke.sh** (NEW) - Runtime behavior testing
4. **05-consistency-check.sh** (NEW) - Script reference validation
5. **06-memory-guard.sh** (NEW) - Protects 160MB writing space

### ‚ú® Writer Experience (NICE TO PASS)
6. **03-functionality.sh** - Fun features
7. **07-writer-experience.sh** (NEW) - Error quality & debuggability

## Key Improvements

1. **Runtime Testing**: Docker smoke test validates actual behavior
2. **Consistency Validation**: Catches issues like missing scripts
3. **Memory Protection**: Guards the sacred writing space
4. **Better Categorization**: Tests grouped by writer impact
5. **Faster Execution**: Still under 30 seconds total
6. **Makefile Integration**: Multiple test targets for flexibility

## Makefile Test Commands

```bash
make test           # Run all 7 tests
make test-quick     # Show stoppers only (2 tests)
make test-writing   # Writing blockers (3 tests)
make test-safety    # Just safety check
make test-docker    # Just Docker smoke test
make test-memory    # Just memory guard
```

## Philosophy Maintained

‚úÖ Still a hobby project approach
‚úÖ Focus on writer experience over coverage
‚úÖ Simple enough to understand and fix
‚úÖ No enterprise bloat or complexity
‚ùå Deleted 48 overcomplicated tests

## Migration Note

The `archive/` directory has been completely removed. All those complex unit tests, integration tests, and framework tests are gone. If you need them for reference, they're in git history.
