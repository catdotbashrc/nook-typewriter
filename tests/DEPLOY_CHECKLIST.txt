NOOK DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
═════════════════════════

Before First Hardware Deploy:
□ Run ./run-tests.sh (all pass?)
□ Test in Docker: docker run -it nook-writer
□ Have TWO SD cards ready (main + backup)
□ Know how to restore stock firmware
□ Using SD card, NOT internal storage

Build & Deploy:
□ make clean (start fresh)
□ make firmware
□ make detect-sd (find your SD card)
□ make sd-deploy SD_DEVICE=/dev/sdX
□ Wait for "SD card ready!" message

First Boot:
□ Insert SD card into Nook
□ Hold page buttons while powering on
□ Should see boot messages or jester
□ If stuck: power off, check SD card

If Something Goes Wrong:
□ Don't panic!
□ Remove SD card
□ Nook should boot normally
□ Check SD card on computer
□ Try backup SD card
□ Ask on forum/discord for help

Success Indicators:
□ Boots without hanging
□ Shows menu or shell prompt
□ Can type and save text
□ Power button works
□ No smoke (seriously!)

Remember:
- It's a hobby project, have fun!
- First boot might be slow
- E-Ink refresh is supposed to be slow
- If it boots at all, you've succeeded!
