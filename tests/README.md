# 🧪 Nook Typewriter Tests v2.0 - The 7-Test Sweet Spot

## Philosophy
**Hobby Robust™** - Not enterprise coverage, but writer-focused validation:
1. 🛡️ Won't brick your device
2. ✍️ Writers can actually write
3. 🐛 Debuggable when things go wrong
4. ⚡ 30-second test suite

*"Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship it when writers can write!"*

## The 7-Test Architecture

### Category 1: 🛡️ Show Stoppers (MUST PASS)
**If these fail, DO NOT DEPLOY!**

#### `01-safety-check.sh`
- Kernel image exists
- No dangerous /dev/sda references  
- SD card protection enabled
- Build system ready

#### `02-boot-test.sh`
- Boot scripts exist
- JesterOS service available
- Menu system present
- Common library functions

### Category 2: 🚧 Writing Blockers (SHOULD PASS)
**If these fail, writing experience suffers**

#### `04-docker-smoke.sh` 🆕
- Container starts successfully
- Menu system valid syntax
- Vim installed and configured
- Services create proper directories
- Basic write workflow works

#### `05-consistency-check.sh` 🆕
- All script references valid
- No kernel module attempts (userspace only!)
- Consistent JesterOS naming
- Proper service paths (/var/jesteros)
- No orphaned function calls

#### `06-memory-guard.sh` 🆕
- Scripts stay under size limits
- No node_modules or databases
- Docker image reasonable size
- Protects 160MB writing space
- Warns about memory hogs

### Category 3: ✨ Writer Experience (NICE TO PASS)
**If these fail, less pleasant but still usable**

#### `03-functionality.sh`
- ASCII art jesters ready
- Service scripts available
- Vim configuration present
- Docker environment built

#### `07-writer-experience.sh` 🆕
- Scripts have error handling
- Human-readable error messages
- Medieval theme consistency
- No silent failures
- Clear success indicators

## How to Test

```bash
# Run all 7 tests (takes ~30 seconds)
./run-tests.sh

# Or run by category
./01-safety-check.sh     # Must pass!
./02-boot-test.sh        # Must pass!
./04-docker-smoke.sh     # Should pass
./05-consistency-check.sh # Should pass
./06-memory-guard.sh     # Should pass
./03-functionality.sh    # Nice to have
./07-writer-experience.sh # Nice to have
```

## Test Results

- **All 7 Pass**: Perfect score! Ship it! 🚀
- **Show Stoppers Fail**: DO NOT DEPLOY! Device damage risk!
- **Writing Blockers Fail**: Can deploy, but writing impacted
- **Experience Tests Fail**: Deploy anyway, iterate later

## Before Hardware Deploy

Check `DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.txt` - it's literally a checklist!

## FAQ

**Q: Why 7 tests instead of 3?**
A: The sweet spot - catches real issues without enterprise bloat.

**Q: What's new in v2.0?**
A: Docker runtime testing, consistency checking, memory protection, and error quality validation.

**Q: Should I run the archived tests?**
A: No! They're being deleted. 7 focused tests > 48 complex ones.

**Q: What if Writing Blockers fail?**
A: You can deploy, but fix them soon for better experience.

**Q: How long do tests take?**
A: ~30 seconds total. Still faster than making coffee!

## The Only Commands You Need

```bash
# Before deploying to Nook
make test          # Runs ./run-tests.sh

# Full build and deploy
make clean         # Start fresh
make firmware      # Build everything  
make test          # Run tests
make sd-deploy     # Deploy to SD card
```

## If Tests Fail

1. **Show Stoppers fail**: STOP! Fix before any hardware deployment
2. **Writing Blockers fail**: Can deploy, but prioritize fixes
3. **Experience tests fail**: Ship it, improve iteratively

## What's Being Tested

- **Safety**: Device won't brick, proper SD card handling
- **Runtime**: Actually runs in Docker, services work
- **Consistency**: All scripts properly connected
- **Memory**: Protects the 160MB writing space
- **Experience**: Error messages helpful, not cryptic
